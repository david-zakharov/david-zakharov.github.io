## INTRO
Our environment is shaped by the reactions that occur at the interface between the hydrosphere, atmosphere, and silicate Earth. My endeavors involve developing novel approaches in isotope geochemistry to study how environmental conditions are imprinted in the rock record through such reactions. I like to think about the following questions: What is the connection between the evolution of continental crust and the long-term changes in climate? What are the feedbacks between seawater dissolved content, atmospheric chemistry and the rock cycle? What are the formations, minerals and isotope systems that offer proxies for unreacted seawater or local precipitation?

My work focuses on <b>O-isotope</b> geochemistry including O-17, Precambrian geology and water-rock interaction. I routinely measure δD, δ<sup>17</sup>O and δ<sup>18</sup>O in sedimentary, igneous, and hydrothermally altered rocks to learn something new about the environment at the time. Normally, I like to study old (Precambrian) rocks because there are fewer reliable environmental proxies, thus, the world is less constrained, and the approaches must be creative. I also enjoy studying modern environments, be it altered oceanic crust, hydrothermal vent fluids or a geothermal plant.


## PROJECTS

As a lead scientists, I have targeted:

|    - [Surface temperatures and timing of melt-water infiltration during Snowball Earth glaciations](https://doi.org/10.1130/G38759.1)
|    - [Seawater isotope value recorded in well-preserved 2.41 Ga altered basalts](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2019.01.014)
|    - Changes in altered oceanic crust in relation to evolving marine solutes 2.41 Ga (in press)
|    - [O-17 signals of modern seawater/meteoric water - basalt reactions in Iceland](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2019.119312)
|    - [Potential connections between cratons in the Paleoproterozoic based on O-isotopes](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.precamres.2019.105431)
|    - [Precambrian (and now modern) chert-forming fluids based on O-17 measurements and micrometer-scale heterogeneities](https://doi.org/10.2138/rmg.2021.86.10)


`On-going projects` include using Secondary Ion Probe measurements of stable isotopes to answer questions in hydrothermal reactivity of seawater in oceanic crust, diagenetic maturation of cherts, triple O isotope geochemistry of terrestrial rocks, rock-water exchange experiments.


## SHORT BIO AND CV

I did my undergraduate degree at the Russian State Geological Prospecting University in Moscow studying general and economic geology with specific focus on geochemistry and mineralogy of ore deposits. My PhD was done at the University of Oregon under supervision of Ilya Bindeman. For my postdoctoral research, I am investigating Archean sedimentary records at the SwissSIMS laboratory of the University of Lausanne. The analytical endeavors include laser fluorination, high-precision gas source mass spectrometery and secondary ion probe measurements. My field work has taken me to Russian Karelia, Scottish Highlands and Iceland. See my <b>[CV](files/CV.pdf)</b>.
